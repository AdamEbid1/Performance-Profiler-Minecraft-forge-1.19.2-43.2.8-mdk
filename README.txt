#Lag Profiler Mod for Multiplayer Minecraft

Lag Profiler is a performance analysis tool specifically designed for multiplayer servers of a popular sandbox video game called Minecraft. The game allows players to build and explore virtual worlds made up of blocks, providing an immersive experience. However, complex constructions and interactions between game elements can sometimes lead to performance issues, commonly known as lag, which degrades the gameplay experience.

This mod addresses these performance issues by intelligently identifying and diagnosing the sources of lag within the game world. It does this through a two-step process:
   
   Identifying forced chunks: The mod first identifies the most resource-intensive sections of the game world, known as forced chunks. These are areas where the game's simulation must always be active, even when players are not present.

   Profiling chunk performance: The mod then measures the time taken to process in-game elements within these forced chunks, effectively pinpointing the primary contributors to lag.

By providing valuable information to server administrators, the Lag Profiler Mod allows them to identify and address the sources of lag efficiently, ultimately leading to a smoother gameplay experience for all players on the server.
